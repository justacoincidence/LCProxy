# Lunar Proxy Full Source Code
Lunar Proxy was a tool that allowed you to unlock cosmetics for free by redirecting LC API requests to your server, After gaining a lot of notoriety they received a DMCA take down request from the owners
of Lunar Client. At my recommendation they leaked their source code to the public as a final fuck you to Lunar Client. I take no credit for this code. I'm only reuploading it in case the original repositories get taken down
